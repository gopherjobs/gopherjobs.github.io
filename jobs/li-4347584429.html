<p>Wedo has partnered with a Tech4Good Series B start-up who are building technology that impacts tens of millions of people every year. Our client is a B Corp, featured as one of the fastest-growing companies in the UK, and they’re now looking for a Staff Software Engineer who can own Go service development for their core platform, while having a wider impact by owning architecture patterns, setting standards, influencing strategy, and driving wider Go adoption.</p>
<p>Their previous services were written in Node/Next.js, which hit performance limits. They put together a Go proof of concept which showed they could 10x performance, so all new services and feature development are now being built in Golang. They have 2 Go Engineers in the business and are hiring 2 more. This is an IC role and suitable for anyone who’s already a Senior looking to step up, or someone already operating at Principal or Staff level.</p>

<li>Improve system performance, data modelling, reliability and UX</li>
<li>Shape architectural decisions and unblock complex problems</li>
<li>Mentor engineers adopting Go and level up engineering standards</li>
<li>Champion product-thinking, always tying decisions back to user need</li>
</ul>
<p>What You’ll Bring</p>
<ul>
<li>Commercial experience building Go services in production in at least 2 different companies</li>
<li>Willingness to unblock yourself and work with TypeScript/React for ~10% of the work, with appetite to learn on the job</li>
<li>PostgreSQL expertise</li>
<li>Automated testing mindset (ideally TDD)</li>
<li>Solid grounding in design patterns</li>
<li>Cloud deployment experience (Kubernetes preferred)</li>
<li>Kafka, Debezium or broader event-driven systems knowledge</li>
<li>AWS experience</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll Thrive Here If You Are…</p>

<li>Excited by scale, ambiguity, and building from the ground up</li>
<li>Curious, collaborative, and generous with knowledge</li>
<li>Someone who gives and receives feedback well</li>
<li>Able to influence direction, not just follow it</li>
<li>Product-thinking, pragmatic, and comfortable making trade-offs</li>
